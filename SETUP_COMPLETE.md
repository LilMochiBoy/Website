## üì± TWO OPTIONS TO GET YOUR APP:

## OPTION 1: Install as PWA (Easiest - NO Java needed!)

### What is it?
A Progressive Web App installs directly from your browser - no app store needed!

### Steps on Your Android Phone:

1. **Start Your Server** (on PC)
   ```powershell
   cd 'C:\Users\Reynard Jave Hanson\Desktop\Crawler\Website'
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Find Your PC's IP Address** (on PC)
   ```powershell
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (something like 192.168.x.x)

3. **Open in Chrome on Your Phone**
   - Open Chrome browser on your Android
   - Go to: `http://[YOUR_PC_IP]:3000` (e.g., http://192.168.1.10:3000)
   - Make sure your phone and PC are on the same WiFi network!

4. **Install the App**
   - Chrome will show an "Install" button in the address bar or at the bottom
   - Tap "Install Zendo"
   - The app will be added to your home screen
   - Open it - it runs like a native app!

### PWA Benefits:
- ‚úÖ No Java/Android Studio needed
- ‚úÖ Instant installation
- ‚úÖ Works offline (service worker)
- ‚úÖ Updates automatically when you update the website
- ‚úÖ Can be shared with anyone via URL

## OPTION 2: Build Native APK (Full App - Requires Java)

### What is it?
A real Android APK file that can be installed on any Android phone or published to Play Store.

### Prerequisites (You Need to Install):
1. **Java JDK 17** - [Download Here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)
   - Download the Windows x64 MSI installer
   - Install it
   - Restart PowerShell after installation

2. **Android Studio** (Optional but Recommended)
   - [Download Here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   - Needed for: customizing app icon, signing for Play Store, using visual IDE

### Steps After Installing Java:

1. **Verify Java Installation**
   ```powershell
   java -version
   ```
   Should show: `openjdk version "17.x.x"`

2. **Build Debug APK**
   ```powershell
   cd 'C:\Users\Reynard Jave Hanson\Desktop\Crawler\Website\android'
   .\gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   *First build takes 5-10 minutes (downloads dependencies)*

3. **Find Your APK**
   The APK will be at:
   ```
   C:\Users\Reynard Jave Hanson\Desktop\Crawler\Website\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
   ```

4. **Install on Your Phone**
   - **Method A**: Transfer APK via USB cable and install
   - **Method B**: Upload to Google Drive, download on phone, install
   - **Method C**: Use ADB (if enabled USB debugging):
     ```powershell
     adb install -r android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
     ```

### Building Release APK (For Play Store):

1. **Open Android Studio**
   ```powershell
   npx cap open android
   ```

2. **Generate Signed APK**
   - Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle / APK
   - Choose "Android App Bundle" (AAB)
   - Create keystore (SAVE YOUR PASSWORDS!)
   - Build release
   - Upload AAB to Google Play Console

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION: Start with OPTION 1 (PWA)

**Why?**
- Test your app immediately (5 minutes)
- No additional software needed
- See if everything works before investing time in native build
- You can always do Option 2 later

**When to use Option 2?**
- You want to publish to Play Store
- You need native features (camera, GPS, etc.) - though we haven't added those yet
- You want a standalone APK file to share
